# FutureGame
##Javascript
Or proyect consisted of a series of minigames. The player select wich one of them want to play. 
They are easy to play ( and lose ) for more entertaiment. 
The games _DOESN'T_ run correctly on GOOGLE CHROME, so we define the prefered browsers as: Opera and Mozilla. 
For cloning the repo use :
$ git clone https://github.com/FutureUN/FutureGame.git

For the game we used the P5 js play libraries. Used for the creation of games and plaything.
